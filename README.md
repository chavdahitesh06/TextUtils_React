## Introduction

This project is a simple React.js application intended for beginners who are just getting started with React.js. It demonstrates the basics of building a React component, managing state, and handling events. 

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: React requires Node.js for running the application locally. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn**: Node Package Manager (npm) comes with Node.js, or you can use yarn as an alternative package manager.

To verify installation, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-beginner-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd react-beginner-project
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    If using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    If using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

If using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

If using yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

The app will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default. Open this URL in your browser to view your running React application.

### Folder Structure

The basic folder structure of this React project is as follows:

```
react-beginner-project/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
```

- **src/**: Contains all source files, including components and app logic.
- **public/**: Holds the static files, including `index.html` where the React app is injected.
- **components/**: A folder for holding all reusable React components.
- **App.js**: The main application component.
- **index.js**: Entry point of the React app where the app gets rendered.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  
- **`npm build`**: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- **`npm eject`**: If you need to customize the configuration, this command will remove the single build dependency and allow you to modify the build setup directly.
